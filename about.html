            <p> ✨ Fernanda was born in May 31<sup>st</sup> 1992 in Ensenada, Baja California, México. She was the fourth
                child of Tomas and Mercedes 🥰 and the youngest sister of Luz, Tomas, and Ariana. Her childhood was like
                the other children at the time; play outside with no computers (and no Internet). However, when Fernanda
                was nine years old meet for the first time a computer. Since that day, she thought, <i>“I want to study
                    something related to computers when I grow up”</i>. Nowadays she is a Computers Engineer and an
                enthusiast of User Experience (UX Design) design for web or mobile applications. 👩‍🎨</p>
